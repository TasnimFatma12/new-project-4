				<h2>Welcome.</h2>
				<p>There are two sites here: a public site and a personal site where people log<br> in to create a financial profile for analysis. This project was one of my biggest challenges. I did not build each of these two sites once, but 3 separate times as our team kept having to meet new implementation restrictions dictated by the client. I learned the most on this project about layout in HTML and consider this experience a benchmark in my career. I have been able to build almost anything ever since.</p>
